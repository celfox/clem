Clem is a Warframe bot for Discord.

Current features:

- It tracks alerts.
- You can search for items and get their components and stuff.

It's kind of terrible, sorry.

Commands:

.search <item-partial-name>
.alerts

Note: alert notification happens automatically. There are separate emoji for nitain vs non-nitain.
